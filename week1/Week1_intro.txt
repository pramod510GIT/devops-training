Itâ€™s a way of working where development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams come together to build, test, and run software faster and more reliably.

Instead of working separately, they:

Automate tasks (like code testing, deployments, and server setup).

Use tools to continuously integrate and deliver code (CI/CD).

Monitor applications in real-time for performance and security.

The main goal: deliver software quickly, with fewer errors, and keep it running smoothly.
